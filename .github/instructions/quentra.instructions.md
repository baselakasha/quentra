# Project
Quentra
# Project Description
Quentra is a personal finance management application that helps users track their expenses, manage budgets, and gain insights into their financial habits.
# Project stack
Quentra has a backend rest api in the /api folder and a frontend in the /frontend folder. The backend is built with Typescript, Node.js and Express, while the frontend is developed using Angular.


# Typescript guidelines
- Use Typescript for all new code.
- Use interfaces for data structures and type definitions
- Prefer immutable data (const, readonly)
- Use optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) operators
